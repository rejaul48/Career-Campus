## React Concepts Used in Career Campus

**Component-Based Architecture:** The app is built with reusable, modular components like MyProfile and DetailsPage, promoting scalability and maintainability. <br>

**Context API for Global State Management:** CareerContext handles user data globally, ensuring seamless access to profile information across components without prop drilling. <br>

**State and Event Handling:** State is managed using useState and useEffect for dynamic updates, like toggling edit modes and fetching post data based on route parameters. <br>

**React Router for Navigation:** React Router enables smooth navigation between pages, like profile and details pages, using dynamic routing with useParams for ID-based data fetching.<br>

**Conditional Rendering:** The app conditionally renders elements based on state, such as toggling between input fields and static text in the MyProfile component.<br>


## Data Management Strategy in Career Campus

**Context API for Centralized State:** User profile data and loading states are managed globally using Context API, allowing consistent data access and updates across components. <br>

**State Synchronization with useEffect:** useEffect ensures state updates based on changes in data, keeping the UI synchronized with the latest user or post information.<br>

**Efficient Data Fetching:** Data is loaded and filtered using useLoaderData and dynamic URL parameters, ensuring accurate and efficient fetching for post details.<br>
